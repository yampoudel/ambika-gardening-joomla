SIGPLUS_FIELDSET_BASIC="Basic settings"
SIGPLUS_BASE_FOLDER="Base folder"
SIGPLUS_BASE_FOLDER_DESCRIPTION="Base directory w.r.t. which relative image gallery paths in the activation tag are interpreted. Use a path relative to Joomla root or an absolute path (advanced users only). Setting the base folder to <code>images</code> (default) and writing <code>{gallery}sigplus/birds{/gallery}</code> in a content item maps to the file system path <code><var>root</var>/images/sigplus/birds</code>. If you use a path that points outside the Joomla root, you must also set <em>Base URL</em>."
SIGPLUS_LAYOUT="Gallery layout"
SIGPLUS_LAYOUT_DESCRIPTION="The way the image gallery is rendered. <em>Fixed layout</em> is a table-like environment with a set number of rows and columns, and a fixed width and height, where preview images occupy cells of a table. Fixed layout is associated with a rotator and navigation controls, showing only part of the entire gallery at a time. <em>Flow layout</em> renders preview images as if they were words of a text, allowing the series of images to span multiple lines if they would not fit into a single line, just as normal text breaks into lines if it is too long to fit into a single line. Flow layout is very flexible but does not permit an image rotator. <em>Packed layout</em>, with its manual image slider, can be seen as a compromise between fixed layout and flow layout, and also comes with limited configurability. <em>Hidden layout</em> (only available for the plug-in) makes sigplus render the gallery without any user interface directly on the page; images in a hidden gallery can only be accessed with a pop-up window that is linked to it."
SIGPLUS_LAYOUT_FIXED="fixed (with rotator)"
SIGPLUS_LAYOUT_FLOW="flow (without rotator)"
SIGPLUS_LAYOUT_PACKED="packed (without rotator)"
SIGPLUS_LAYOUT_HIDDEN="hidden"
SIGPLUS_ROWS="Image row count"

SIGPLUS_COLUMNS="Image column count"
SIGPLUS_COLUMNS_DESCRIPTION="Number of columns used to display preview images. This setting has no effect when flow layout is used."
SIGPLUS_MAXCOUNT="Maximum image count"
SIGPLUS_MAXCOUNT_DESCRIPTION="Maximum number of preview images to show. If set to zero, all images in the gallery will be shown as previews, possibly broken down into multiple pages. If set to a positive integer, only the specified number of preview images will be displayed, even though it is still possible to view all images when browsing the gallery inside the lightbox pop-up window."
SIGPLUS_ALIGNMENT="Alignment on page"
SIGPLUS_ALIGNMENT_DESCRIPTION="Horizontal alignment of the image gallery on the page. Values that end in <code>float</code> allow text to wrap around the gallery, values that end in <code>clear</code> do not. The options <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> use language-sensitive alignment, i.e. <code>before</code> automatically takes a value of <code>left</code> for left-to-right (LTR) and a value of <code>right</code> for right-to-left (RTL) languages, while the option <code>after</code> is the opposite of <code>before</code>. The options <code>before</code> and <code>after</code> are intended for multilingual sites (e.g. English and Hebrew)."

SIGPLUS_PREVIEW_HEIGHT_DESCRIPTION="Default height of preview images to generate [px]. Use the special value <code>0</code> with cropping disabled to have the image preview height automatically computed from original image width. Either the preview image width or height must be non-zero."
SIGPLUS_PREVIEW_CROP="Crop when rescaling"
SIGPLUS_PREVIEW_CROP_DESCRIPTION="Crop overflowing dimensions when scaling images to preview image size. If set to <em>yes</em> and the ratio of preview image width and height differs from that of the original image, excess parts of the original image are cropped from top and bottom or left and right when rescaling to preview image dimensions. If set to <em>no</em>, the preview image always shows the entire image and the appropriate dimension is reduced. As an example, suppose preview image width and height is set to 100&nbsp;px. With cropping on, the left and right part of an image with width 400&nbsp;px and height 200&nbsp;px will be cut off, and the resulting center 200&nbsp;px-by-200&nbsp;px part will be shrunk to preview image size. With cropping off, the entire image will be used to generate the preview image such that the preview image will have dimensions 100&nbsp;px and 50&nbsp;px."
SIGPLUS_LIGHTBOX="Lightbox pop-up type"

SIGPLUS_LIGHTBOX_AUTOFIT="Fit to window"
SIGPLUS_LIGHTBOX_AUTOFIT_DESCRIPTION="Whether to automatically reduce oversized images to fit the browser window when they are displayed. Flash and video are always shown in their predefined size, even if they would not fit the screen. When autofit is enabled, an expand/contract control will be shown (typically in the top right corner of the image) to let the user view the image in its original size. Not all pop-up window engines support fit to window."
SIGPLUS_LIGHTBOX_THUMBS="Lightbox navigation bar"
SIGPLUS_LIGHTBOX_THUMBS_DESCRIPTION="Placement of thumbnail navgiation bar relative to the image shown inside lightbox. When the navigation bar is superimposed over the image, it is only shown while the mouse pointer is within the hotspot area of the navigation container.

SIGPLUS_ROTATOR_ORIENTATION="Image rotator orientation"
SIGPLUS_ROTATOR_ORIENTATION_DESCRIPTION="Orientation of the image rotator viewport. Horizontally oriented rotators move from the right to the left, vertically oriented rotators move from downwards to upwards. Setting the number of rows and columns for the gallery does not affect rotator orientation, which determines the direction the image rotator moves, i.e. it is possible to have a 1-by-3 fixed layout gallery rotating either horizontally or vertically. Images are automatically ordered in the grid to take into account orientation, independently of the number of rows and columns."

SIGPLUS_ROTATOR_TRIGGER_CLICK="click"
SIGPLUS_ROTATOR_TRIGGER_MOUSEOVER="mouse-over"
SIGPLUS_ROTATOR_STEP="Trigger action step"
SIGPLUS_ROTATOR_STEP_DESCRIPTION="Unit to advance the rotator upon clicking navigation controls <em>Previous</em> and <em>Next</em>. The value <em>page</em> navigates the user to the next set of images, i.e. each of the images currently shown is replaced with another image or empty space, whereas the value <em>single</em> advances the rotator by a single image, a single row or a single column, depending on context."
SIGPLUS_ROTATOR_STEP_SINGLE="single"
SIGPLUS_ROTATOR_STEP_PAGE="page"

; Administration back-end advanced settings
SIGPLUS_FIELDSET_ADVANCED="Advanced settings"
SIGPLUS_DOWNLOAD="Download access level"
SIGPLUS_DOWNLOAD_DESCRIPTION="Access level required to show the download icon in pop-up window and in captions. When the user with the appropriate access level (e.g. Registered) clicks the icon, the browser prompts the user to save the original image to their local computer. If a high-resolution image is available in a separate folder, the user will be prompted to download that image, otherwise the same image will be downloaded as displayed in the pop-up window."
SIGPLUS_METADATA="Metadata access level"
SIGPLUS_METADATA_DESCRIPTION="Access level required to show the metadata icon in pop-up window and in captions. When the user with the appropriate access level (e.g. Registered) clicks the icon, metadata and other digital camera information and other image metadata like caption, summary, creator and copyright are displayed in a separate scrollable pop-up window. Some pop-up window implementations do not permit displaying metadata."
SIGPLUS_PROTECTION="Image protection"
SIGPLUS_PROTECTION_DESCRIPTION="Whether to employ client-side image protection measures. Client-side image protection captures and suppresses mouse right-click (<em>contextmenu</em>) and drag-and-drop actions (<em>dragstart</em>), thereby preventing visitors from easily saving images to their own computer. While useful against a large group of users, client-side prevention mechanisms are completely ineffective against power users who can easily extract images by saving a page snapshot or inspecting the temporary internet files folder, which cannot be prevented with any scripting measure. For a safer alternative, consider watermarking (on the server) instead, which will irreversibly embed a watermark in the image. Not all pop-up window engines support client-side protection."
SIGPLUS_CHOOSE="Choose"
SIGPLUS_CSS_MARGIN="Preview margin"
SIGPLUS_CSS_MARGIN_DESCRIPTION="Margin around preview images [px]; use a number with or without a unit, numbers without a unit default to pixels (<code>px</code>).

SIGPLUS_CSS_BORDER_COLOR="Preview border color"
SIGPLUS_CSS_BORDER_COLOR_DESCRIPTION="Color of border to display around preview images.  If omitted, the border color specified in the style sheet file (<code>sigplus.css</code>) applies. Specify a hexadecimal value between #000000 and #FFFFFF inclusive in the RGB system (red: #FF0000, green: #00FF00, blue: #0000FF), or use the color picker. If border style is <em>none</em>, this setting has no effect."
SIGPLUS_CSS_PADDING="Preview padding"
SIGPLUS_CSS_PADDING_DESCRIPTION="Padding around preview images [px]; use a number with or without a unit, numbers without a unit default to pixels (<code>px</code>). The padding clears an area directly around the preview image within border bounds. If omitted, the padding specified in the style sheet file (<code>sigplus.css</code>) applies."

SIGPLUS_CACHE_IMAGE="Folder for caching images"
SIGPLUS_CACHE_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION="Whether to use Joomla cache folder, the Joomla media folder, or the image source folder for storing generated preview images and thumbnails. This setting has no performance implications, it only affects how generated images are organized on the server. If the Joomla cache (or media) folder is chosen, generated image folders are created inside the cache (or media) folder, letting you clean up generated images directly from the Joomla back-end with a few clicks. Since the cache folder is shared across all galleries, image file names are hashed to avoid name conflicts. If the image source folder is chosen, generated image folders are created as child folders of their respective image source folders. A subdirectory naming scheme ensures that generated images of different sizes and cropping methods do not overwrite one another when configuration settings are altered."
SIGPLUS_CACHE_JOOMLA_CACHE_FOLDER="Joomla cache folder"

Thumbnail images are low-resolution images with width and height of at most 100 pixels used inside a pop-up window to help navigation. Use a relative path, which is interpreted w.r.t. the image folder (or the cache folder). With no cache folder use, default image base and thumbnail folder, using <code>sigplus/birds</code> as the images folder causes thumbnails to be read from <code><var>root</var>/images/sigplus/birds/thumbs</code>. Appropriate file permissions are required to automatically create this folder and the thumbnails within."
SIGPLUS_FOLDER_PREVIEW="Preview folder"
SIGPLUS_FOLDER_PREVIEW_DESCRIPTION="Subdirectory to store preview images. Preview images are low- to medium-resolution images typically displayed in an image rotator. Preview images are retrieved from the server on demand, i.e. only those preview images are downloaded that are being shown. Use a relative path, which is interpreted w.r.t. the image source folder (or the cache folder). With no cache folder use, default image base and preview image folder, using <code>sigplus/birds</code> as the images folder causes preview images to be read from <code><var>root</var>/images/sigplus/birds/preview</code>. Appropriate file permissions are required to automatically create this folder and the preview images within."
SIGPLUS_FOLDER_FULLSIZE="Folder for originals"
SIGPLUS_FOLDER_FULLSIZE_DESCRIPTION="Subdirectory to look for high-resolution original images. When the user clicks the download icon, the browser will prompt to save the image in this folder to the user's local computer instead of the (possibly lower-resolution) image that is being shown in the lightbox pop-up window. The full-size image folder is useful for providing a high-quality image version for archival or printing rather than web browsing. If no high-quality version is available, the same image as shown in the lightbox pop-up window will be downloaded. Use a relative path, which is interpreted w.r.t. the image source folder."

SIGPLUS_CAPTION_SOURCE="Filename for labels"
SIGPLUS_CAPTION_SOURCE_DESCRIPTION="Name to use for the text file (with extension) that contains image labels and descriptions."
SIGPLUS_MULTILINGUAL="Use multilingual labels"
SIGPLUS_MULTILINGUAL_DESCRIPTION="Support language-sensitive image file labeling. If enabled, labels file is selected based on the site language, e.g. English (UK) uses <code>labels.en-GB.txt</code>. Multilingual support is useful if your site displays in multiple languages, e.g. by means of the <em>Joomfish</em> component. Should you have a labels file <code>labels.en-GB.txt</code> for English visitors and a <code>labels.pt-PT.txt</code> for Portuguese visitors, sigplus will use the language file that matches the visitor's current language. If no labels file is found with the matching language, there is a fallback to <code>labels.txt</code> as if multilingual support was not enabled. If your site uses a single language (which should not necessarily be English), you can safely disable multilingual support and use a <code>labels.txt</code> file to store your captions."
SIGPLUS_TAG_GALLERY="Gallery activation tag"
SIGPLUS_TAG_GALLERY_DESCRIPTION="Sets the activation tag used for invoking sigplus. Changing this setting is recommended only if sigplus conflicts with another image gallery plug-in that would also be activated with the <code>{gallery}</code> tag.

SIGPLUS_TAG_LIGHTBOX_DESCRIPTION="Sets the activation tag used for associating a link with the lightbox pop-up window. Changing this setting is recommended only if sigplus conflicts with another lightbox plug-in that would also be activated with the <code>{lightbox}</code> tag. The tag name may only contain (English) letters and is case-sensitive."
SIGPLUS_SETTINGS_ADDITIONAL="Additional settings"
SIGPLUS_SETTINGS_ADDITIONAL_DESCRIPTION="Parameters as <kbd>name=value</kbd> pairs to pass unaltered to sigplus. For the plug-in, this is equivalent to specifying these parameters in every single occurrence of the activation tag; for the module, it allows customization that would not otherwise be available via controls in the back-end. For example, when using the boxplus lightbox window, passing the <kbd>lightbox:contextmenu=0</kbd> parameter disables the context menu when right-clicking an image in the pop-up window. For the complete list of parameters, consult the sigplus documentation."

SIGPLUS_BASE_URL="Base URL"
SIGPLUS_BASE_URL_DESCRIPTION="Base URL that corresponds to absolute base folder. This field should be left empty if the base folder is a relative path w.r.t. the Joomla root directory. However, if an absolute path is specified for the base folder, which typically happens when images are served from the same file system but under a different domain or subdomain, this setting determines what to prefix image folder paths with."
SIGPLUS_LIBRARY_JSAPI="JavaScript library source"
SIGPLUS_LIBRARY_JSAPI_DESCRIPTION="Source for JavaScript libraries not native to the Joomla framework (e.g. jQuery). Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to fetch script libraries when the site is exposed to the public internet, in which case the pages of your site may load significantly faster. On the other hand, you might want to set JavaScript library source to a <em>local copy</em> if your template uses a script merger or your site is accessible only within a (corporate) intranet; or <em>none</em> if you use a separate system plug-in to load script libraries. This setting (with a value other than <em>none</em>) only affects performance, not functionality. The setting has no effect when only the MooTools framework is in use, which is served by Joomla."

SIGPLUS_LIBRARY_IMAGE="Image processing library"
SIGPLUS_LIBRARY_IMAGE_DESCRIPTION="Image processing library to use for generating thumbnail, preview and watermarked images. Only those PHP libraries are listed that are supported by your system. When this setting reads <em>none</em>, you will not be able to use automatic image generation services normally provided by sigplus, and will have to supply your own images generated off-line."

SIGPLUS_DEBUG_CLIENT="Client debug mode"
SIGPLUS_DEBUG_CLIENT_DESCRIPTION="Whether to use uncompressed versions of lightbox and rotator engine scripts. Normally, compressed and obfuscated versions of these scripts are used to conserve network bandwidth usage. Debug mode is useful if you experience a script error on a page and you would like to discover its cause, which is difficult to perform with obfuscated names. When asking for support, please make sure to enable client debug mode."
SIGPLUS_DEBUG_SERVER="Server debug mode"
SIGPLUS_DEBUG_SERVER_DESCRIPTION="The verbosity level of printing error, warning and status messages of actions performed on the server. This allows identifying any problematic points (e.g. an unrecognized image format) encountered while a gallery is being generated. The default behavior is to show error and warning messages, and reveal the gallery parameters. The level <em>laconic</em> allows only for a very generic error message and hides as much information as possible. The level <em>verbose</em> displays a detailed log trace. The level <em>none</em> hides even the most critical error messages."

SIGPLUS_EXCEPTION_URLENCODING="URLs are assumed to have been URL-encoded but the URL <code>{$url}</code> appears to have an invalid character."
SIGPLUS_EXCEPTION_TEXTFORMAT="Text files are assumed to be plain text with UTF-8 character encoding but <code>{$textfile}</code> uses a different format or encoding."
SIGPLUS_EXCEPTION_HTML="Image source is expected to be typed as plain text but <code>{$value}</code> appears to contain HTML tags. Please make sure the image source path or URL is either entered using the keyboard or pasted as plain text."
SIGPLUS_EXCEPTION_SOURCE="Image source is expected to be a full URL or a path relative to the image base folder specified in the back-end but <code>{$value}</code> is neither a URL nor a relative path to an existing file or folder."
SIGPLUS_EXCEPTION_CASE_MISMATCH="Image source <code>{$given}</code> cannot be found with a case-sensitive search but a file system entry <code>{$existing}</code> exists. While some operating systems (e.g. Windows) are case-insensitive, others (e.g. Linux) are case-sensitive in matching file system entries. On this server, the image source must match the file system entry exactly, including character case."
SIGPLUS_EXCEPTION_FEED="Invalid RSS or Atom feed URL <code>{$value}</code>. When displaying web albums hosted at Picasa or Flickr, you should use the RSS feed link, not the URL for browsing the web album."

SIGPLUS_EXCEPTION_TIMEOUT="An execution time-out has been encountered while images were being generated. The maximum script execution time is server-specific. Exceeding the maximum execution time is typically the result of many images or a few excessively large images in a gallery. You may re-load the page to let sigplus continue the process. If you periodically get this error message, try reducing the number or size of images in the gallery. If you pass this stage, however, you can be sure your visitors will never encounter this error message, which is associated with an operation that is a one-time cost when a gallery is shown for the first time."
SIGPLUS_EXCEPTION_DOWNLOAD_ACCESS="The image is not available for download; you lack access permissions or the image no longer exists."
SIGPLUS_EXCEPTION_DOWNLOAD_HEADERS="The image <code>{$file}</code> cannot be downloaded, HTTP response headers have already been sent. This indicates a conflict with another extension that manipulates HTTP headers."
